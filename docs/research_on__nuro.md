# Background of Nuro
Nuro is an American robotics company developping autonomous delivery vehicles.
## Nuro's approach on Delivering Safety







## introduction to that company
We believe that great technology should benefit everyone. Self-driving vehicles promise to save lives, make our days easier, and help us connect to the people and things we love. At Nuro, we’re pushing the boundaries of robotics to make those benefits available to anyone, anywhere, anytime.
Safety is our top priority. More than 1 million people die in car crashes around the world every year, and 94% are the result of human error.1 Self-driving vehicles could prevent many of those accidents and save thousands of lives. To do that, they need to be designed, built, and operated with safety in mind, and made broadly accessible.
That’s why we created the first fully self-driving, on-road vehicle designed to transport goods. We believe that self-driving delivery, and thus the resulting benefits, can be scaled sooner and more affordably, than self-driving passenger transportation. Our custom vehicle is engineered to make de- livery of everything more accessible — from groceries to pet food, prescription drugs to dry cleaning.

With no driver or passengers to worry about, our vehicle can be built to keep what’s outside even safer than what’s inside. It’s lighter, nimbler, and slower than a passenger car, and is equipped with state-of-the-art software and sensing capabilities that never get distracted. With its smaller size and manufacturing costs, we can make vehicles more rapidly. And because it’s electric and fully self-driving, our vehicle can deliver life’s needs at an affordable price. Overall, this means spending less time on errands, and more time on life.

This Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment report outlines our approach to safety and the progress we have made so far. It is organized in two parts. Part 1 introduces Nuro, our vehicle, and our approach to safety. Part 2 explains how our vehicle fully addresses all 12 safety elements that the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has outlined as critical areas of focus for self-driving vehicles.
